## Importing the LocoDrive

As rust is able to use GitHub repositories directly as dependencies you can simply add 
`locodrive = { git = "https://github.com/juhu1705/locodrive.git" }` to your `Cargo.toml`

## Using the LocoDrive

The LocoDrive has the struct `loco_controller::LocoNetController` made for connecting to a LocoNet over a serial port.
This reader will care of parsing received messages correctly before sending them to you.

### Loco Net information

For getting the needed information about the loco net protocol I mostly used the [rocrail wiki](https://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=loconet:ln-pe-en). Thanks for the detailed information.
